Title: Analyzing COVID-19 Data for Insights and Visualization

Description: 
This project aims to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize COVID-19 data to gain insights into the progression of the pandemic. By scraping data from public health websites, cleaning and structuring the data, and using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project will provide valuable information about the COVID-19 pandemic's impact. 

Goals: 
This project aims to answer questions such as: 
- How has the number of daily COVID-19 cases evolved over the past year?
- What is the trend of COVID-19 recoveries in different regions?
- Are there any correlations betwen government-imposed restrictions and infection rates?
